After running:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```

Here's what to do next:

---

### ✅ Step 1: Navigate into your project

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

* This will start your app locally (usually at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)).

---

### ✅ Step 4 (Optional): Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

* This creates a production-ready build in the `dist/` folder.

---

### ✅ Step 5 (Optional): Preview the production build

```bash
npm run preview
```

* Serves the `dist/` folder locally to test your production build.

---

Let me know if you want to deploy it somewhere (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Docker).
